1
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,730
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,852
Nice to meet you. Nice. Nice to see you.

3
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:26,876
Nice to have you.

4
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:28,812
It's awesome to have another episode in

5
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:31,228
English despite the whole Portuguese that we

6
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:33,004
have here for the fourth season. Already.

7
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:35,500
Thousands of episodes for you to listen.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,988
Actually, not thousands, but hundreds of

9
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:38,508
episodes for you to listen.

10
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:39,842
I'm Casa Pereta.

11
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:41,330
I'm Marco Santos.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,898
I'm Rodrigo Bobbin.

13
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:45,564
And thank you to have you, all of you here.

14
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:48,252
I'm very pleasure to announce that we have a

15
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,772
very nice guest today to talk about out some

16
00:00:50,772 --> 00:00:53,892
DevOps stuff and some secrets, some best practice, and

17
00:00:53,892 --> 00:00:56,628
we will discover this DevOps word, because so far

18
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:59,970
we didn't have any episode about DevOps especially.

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,260
But today we finally have someone who understand

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,910
this because Marcus and Rodrigo doesn't understand shit.

21
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,600
Finally, we can have some specialists about this.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,848
Just before we introduce our episode and our guest, I

23
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:15,208
want to talk that Devcicom podcast has the support from

24
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:19,212
Checkmarks and Nova Eight specialized in security of systems and

25
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,178
safe code, all the links and so on from Nova

26
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:24,258
Eight distributed from Checkmarks in Brazil.

27
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:26,396
It's on the description of this episode on

28
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:29,000
our website and also on the YouTube video.

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,538
Now I need to talk in Portuguese

30
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:33,394
because it's focused on the Brazil.

31
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,890
But guys, Contraband Olympia

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:02:36,480
specializa improves offensive security.

33
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,448
And to remind you that the

34
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,088

35
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:49,662
If you want to develop secure

36
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:51,368
software, talk to the Gold Security.

37
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:54,450
Okay, guys, done with sponsorship.

38
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,396
We'll be rich one day.

39
00:02:56,396 --> 00:02:57,800
We'll be rich one day.

40
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,036
But today, guys, I want to introduce you to

41
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:05,122
Manuela Manchonne, our first, let's say, Italian guest.

42
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:06,866
We already have Venezuelan.

43
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:07,890
We have polish.

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,366
We had Americans.

45
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:11,136
Brazilians, of course. Now.

46
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:12,422
One from Italy.

47
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,880
Manuela, nice to meet you.

48
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,352
Nice to have you.

49
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,542
Thank you for joining.

50
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,624
Thank you for your time.

51
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:21,200
Please introduce yourself, talk a bit.

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
Feel free.

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,710
The stage is yours.

54
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,170
Thank you for the introduction. Hello, everyone.

55
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,882
And it's my first podcast, so I'm quite embarrassed.

56
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:30,980
I'm a very shy person.

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,320
Let's see how this goes.

58
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,590
Very much something about myself.

59
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,054
My name is Manuela and I work with Casio

60
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:48,498
and we have explored certain new topics regarding DevOps

61
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:50,572
and what we can automate and how we can

62
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:53,314
do things in an easier way for our teams.

63
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,612
So that's something I'm very passionate about.

64
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:59,292
And another thing that I want to say about myself is

65
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:02,016
that I managed a lot of change, and change is different.

66
00:04:02,016 --> 00:04:04,886
So, for example, you can see today we are in February.

67
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,480
My son still wants to have his

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,744
little Christmas tree and other decorations there.

69
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:11,268
This is one topic we are going to

70
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:14,906
talk about later when we talk about DevOps

71
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:18,240
culture themes and what happens in real life.

72
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,498
Something else about myself. Okay. I'm in Italy.

73
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:25,156
I'm in Genova, which is a beautiful city.

74
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,598
Come to visit the city if you ever come to Italy.

75
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:32,120
It's becoming quite a popular tourist destination and you need

76
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,062
always to have an anchor to keep your sanity.

77
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:35,570
So this is my sanity.

78
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,480
This is a hardcore engineering project that I'm doing.

79
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,116
It's a sweater. Yeah.

80
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:46,716
You're a true engineer if you

81
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:48,508
can learn how to make anything.

82
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:49,618
And this is another skill

83
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:52,490
that you need never, actually.

84
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,166
This is a hockey mindset.

85
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,310
You need to be good at anything. Absolutely.

86
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,078
There's no limit to the technologies.

87
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:02,608
You can use what you need. Exactly. Very good.

88
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,276
Very good introduction, Manuela. Thank you.

89
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:06,852
For the ones who are just listening to us

90
00:05:06,852 --> 00:05:09,322
on on Spotify or any platform, go to YouTube.

91
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:12,628
You need to see this awesome weather and understand how

92
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:16,132
is this shelter behind Manuela with books and so on.

93
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:16,708
Yeah.

94
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,070
So, okay, guys, let's start with the conversation.

95
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,704
I would start with the first question.

96
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:24,500
Which is the best, Brazilian food or Italian food?

97
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,094
Manuela. Have you tried brain?

98
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:34,744
Not knowledgeable enough to no, I'm kidding, guys.

99
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:35,218
I'm kidding.

100
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,612
But I would say the first thing that we

101
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:40,204
always not the first thing that we always but

102
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:42,848
we have been discussing during the podcast was during

103
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,880
the four years that we are here already.

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,888
Something about future, especially Rodriguez, has

105
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,686
this word for the purpose.

106
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:52,928
Future is the most difficult thing to change in

107
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:56,068
a company, and we have been working through customers

108
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:58,548
to other few colleagues and so on, and we

109
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:00,964
feel that the most difficult part is the future.

110
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:03,188
So, Manuela, what do you think?

111
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:06,968
What do you think that we can do to change future or

112
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:11,190
to introduce a new future to a company, to a team?

113
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,248
How do you see this?

114
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:13,470
This is a real challenge.

115
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,832
We are wrong, and it's easy for you.

116
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,160
How do you see this?

117
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,932
I believe it's difficult for everyone.

118
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,602
Culture is a very powerful

119
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,044
component of everything we do.

120
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:25,554
It's at our core.

121
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,426
We have our own personal culture.

122
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:29,190
We have our family culture.

123
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,416
We are typically immersed in the culture of our

124
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,030
country or the countries where we have lived.

125
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,840
And the same is valid also for our teams or companies.

126
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,780
So there might be some teams that are more open

127
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,004
to change, other teams that are more worried about it.

128
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:49,178
And I think all of these things are very natural.

129
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:54,468
And whenever we need to introduce something and try to get to

130
00:06:54,468 --> 00:06:58,622
a certain goal or targets that we have, we need to respect

131
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:01,368
that and to find a way to work with it.

132
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:05,300
So if someone is having some doubts or some

133
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,808
issues or worries, we cannot just ignore it and

134
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:10,332
say, hey, no, what we are doing is good.

135
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:11,532
We want to do it anyway.

136
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,338
No, we have to work with okay, why is it worried?

137
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:15,346
Why are you worried?

138
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:18,092
Why do you see concern here with this?

139
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:19,436
How can we work with it?

140
00:07:19,436 --> 00:07:21,008
How can we give you what you

141
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,760
need to succeed in this change?

142
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,272
It's extremely difficult, and I struggle a lot

143
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:28,432
with it every time in different ways.

144
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:30,512
I have learned a few tricks, but yeah,

145
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:33,570
there are more tricks to learn, I'm sure.

146
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,012
Interesting podrigo, you have some comments around

147
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,826
future because we like this topic.

148
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:43,076
Yeah, I like very much.

149
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,760
And about the DevOps too.

150
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,436
I see the biggest chalk of the future.

151
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,168
I see in the companies come

152
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:54,632
from the DevOps all the time.

153
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:59,468
I see in that company they make the things for the way

154
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:06,200
and when they come up for the project, how they change.

155
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:15,792
And DevOps is agent for transformation of the

156
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:21,908
company because you know exactly how to the

157
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:26,788
process running and you need to programming the

158
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:29,700
people for to follow the process.

159
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:35,380
So I see the DevOps is the most

160
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,500
important for the change at Qturena company.

161
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,168
I think this is true.

162
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,236
Sometimes I like to visualize this as when we are

163
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:50,572
setting up a production line in a factory where you

164
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,074
can imagine the source code as raw materials.

165
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:58,514
And then we make this assembly line with lots

166
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:01,532
of automation and things and people may have the

167
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:04,288
idea that, okay, before that we were used to

168
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:06,512
do things by hand and maybe there were some

169
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,838
operations that were more difficult or more chaotic.

170
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:11,024
And now a machine is doing that.

171
00:09:11,024 --> 00:09:14,586
So what is the value of other people in that context?

172
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,650
Okay, I don't need to click here anymore.

173
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,892
What else can I do?

174
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,732
Can I do fun things?

175
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:21,572
Can I do things that interest me?

176
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:23,492
Can I do strategic things

177
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:25,950
and that empowers an organization?

178
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,036
Very good point.

179
00:09:28,036 --> 00:09:30,808
Mark, did you have some subject around this?

180
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:34,660
But good or no, because you don't have a future?

181
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,090
I just follow orders.

182
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,716
But we talk a lot of these in the past.

183
00:09:42,716 --> 00:09:46,562
We talk with psychologists

184
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:49,100
about cuter, about everything.

185
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,168
And Manuel explain very well.

186
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:53,660
I don't have more to explain.

187
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,736
When you talk about the production, when you get

188
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:05,428
the manufacturer, for example, and put some process, you

189
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:09,466
have kind of the DevOps from the factors.

190
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:14,440
And the bigger change in our culture in

191
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:21,294
the world come with the industrial revolution.

192
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:28,626
So they just put some process like the biggest

193
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:31,996
change in our world, the modern world come from

194
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:35,750
the VOBs for the factory industry revolution.

195
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,332
Yes, in a way, yes.

196
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,940
Interesting point, very philosophical today.

197
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,200
Thank you for a collaboration online.

198
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,140
I would add to the discussion something like this

199
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,888
about specifically the future, because we already agreed that

200
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:54,422
it's hard to change because of many factors.

201
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:58,036
Like Manuel said, okay, we have our country family stuff

202
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,620
that we are already attached to it and the problem

203
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,494
we face here we are free from security, Manuela.

204
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:07,336
So imagine we are trying to get

205
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:12,200
into company's futures and usually those company

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,140
futures do not have security at all.

207
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,360
Of course, where we work we already have something,

208
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,664
but these companies don't have security at all.

209
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:23,612
So imagine we need to step in with new

210
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:28,226
processes, new tools, new practices, et cetera, et cetera.

211
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:32,144
All these new in stuff in the process.

212
00:11:32,144 --> 00:11:35,494
It kind of bothers them, especially developers,

213
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,638
especially these companies, who has the mentality

214
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:39,616
of we need to deliver as fast

215
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,984
as we can because business cannot stop.

216
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,500
We need to sell more, sell more, sell more.

217
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,892
And they struggle with these new things, even

218
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,004
if there's new things and not from security.

219
00:11:50,004 --> 00:11:51,556
We are talking from security because

220
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,060
it's how we come there.

221
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,870
But usually even for new DevOps processes.

222
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,952
I was working with Rodriguez in a tourism company,

223
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:02,782
biggest in Latin America actually and they were struggled

224
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:06,830
to have DevOps processes because they were waterfall style

225
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,148
and then they moved it to Agile and all

226
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:12,170
this changing was kind of very painful.

227
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:17,426
And what do you feel that it's like smoothly

228
00:12:17,426 --> 00:12:22,176
or easy or technique tips that we can do

229
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,216
to start introducing this new future, this new stuff?

230
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:28,208
For example, this reminds me of when

231
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,774
I started as a configuration manager.

232
00:12:30,774 --> 00:12:35,588
There was no configuration manager, people didn't really know what

233
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,228
it was, I didn't even know what it was.

234
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:41,050
It was the first time I had that kind of role

235
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,804
and I started to look at how I could help people,

236
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:48,286
what was difficult for them and what part of my role

237
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:51,592
could help them and I focused more and more on that.

238
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,736
So you may find out that people are

239
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:55,896
struggling with something and they have a higher

240
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,604
motivation to do something in that area.

241
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:02,332
So that is something where you can start a trust relationship,

242
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:05,596
say oh, you have this problem, you are aware of this

243
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:09,248
problem, you want to change, you have motivation, I'm here to

244
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,128
help you, I can help you in this way and this

245
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:14,140
is the benefit that you will have.

246
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,452
Interesting, maybe with maybe small things that bring

247
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:22,948
value to them and they realize okay, this

248
00:13:22,948 --> 00:13:24,836
is a collaboration that is giving me something.

249
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:27,460
Good point.

250
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,440
Easy, easy, very easy.

251
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,120
It's not easy.

252
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,708
You can't even talk with these people because they will

253
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,360
say no, no, I don't have time for this.

254
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,020
Yes, exactly, they would have time once they trust you.

255
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,016
You showed the great gain when we

256
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:54,572
put some process automation process but the

257
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,572
people don't understand you about this.

258
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:58,912
And then I don't have time to make this

259
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:06,486
but I will give time for you when automated

260
00:14:06,486 --> 00:14:10,518
for you in this process before the DevOps.

261
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:15,890
All the things painful for this when you compile

262
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,828
code, when you build you need to send for

263
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:23,032
server now you don't think about this.

264
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:27,390
You don't have to think you have the tools for duties.

265
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,550
You just think about the product and your code.

266
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:38,172
But don't think about this, just think about the now.

267
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:41,400
Now I will lost 1 minute for building.

268
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,996
Interesting point.

269
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:48,012
Also I would ask another question or put

270
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,320
the discussion in another direction kind of okay,

271
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,968
I heard us actually once that DevOps is

272
00:14:55,968 --> 00:15:00,010
not positioned, it's kind of a mindset.

273
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,160
Do you agree with this?

274
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,040
Yes, I think so.

275
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,340
As a configuration Manager, for me,

276
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,220
DevOps is like a style, okay?

277
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,698
We do configuration managers.

278
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:13,802
We are a control freak.

279
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:15,956
We want to control and track everything.

280
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,520
But DevOps is a style that makes things

281
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,128
very lightweight with lots of tools to do

282
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,416
the tracking, to do the complex stuff.

283
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:24,552
And we have all the data.

284
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:27,276
We don't need to worry about writing a

285
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:30,146
long document that describes the baseline with versions

286
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,954
and gets approved, reviewed, blah, blah, blah.

287
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:33,880
No, it's there, click, done.

288
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:38,492
And that makes me feel very good because

289
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,816
I don't have to sweat the small stuff

290
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,660
and I can focus on strategy instead.

291
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,784
So I like to see as a style, maybe in a

292
00:15:48,784 --> 00:15:52,304
few years there will be yet another style which is different,

293
00:15:52,304 --> 00:16:00,100
even faster, even more with better user experience, more like, hey,

294
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,524
this is a creative service and we're all experiencing it in

295
00:16:03,524 --> 00:16:05,288
a very nice way, like going to a shop.

296
00:16:05,288 --> 00:16:07,700
I don't know what's going to happen in the future.

297
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,398
Those concepts that are at the core

298
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:13,582
of what I do are configuration management.

299
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:18,114
Those are very logical, very deeply rooted

300
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,436
in the nature of what we do.

301
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,868
Then the style could be called DevOps, could

302
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:25,378
be called shop software, blah, blah, blah.

303
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:27,560
Anything interesting?

304
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,908
Another point is like we need to rely because as

305
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,568
you mentioned, like wood is a style, but we need

306
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:39,280
to rely a lot on tools, on tooling, definitely.

307
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,128
Which means we are not pushing buttons all day.

308
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:44,228
Instead, as you mentioned, like we are thinking a

309
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:48,100
strategy of creating an automation or creating a process

310
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,204
or automating a process itself to make this happen

311
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:55,560
in a more agile, efficient way.

312
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,446
So around tooling, do you rely on tooling?

313
00:17:00,446 --> 00:17:03,486
Do you create your own scripts or tools?

314
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:05,367
I would say, how is it for you?

315
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,200
How is your daily stuff? Okay?

316
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,440
Anything goes.

317
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,530
I rely a lot on tools.

318
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,548
We have those basic tools in place for the

319
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:21,248
organization to work and track activities and track everything.

320
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,968
But on top of that, there are extensions, there

321
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:29,040
are discoveries, there are custom scripts and tools, especially

322
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,978
when working with pipelines that build the software.

323
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:34,948
It's very easy and very natural to add your

324
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:37,668
own things, add your own PowerShell, script here and

325
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:40,858
there, a few rest APIs, blah, blah, blah.

326
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,270
Customize the behavior.

327
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,932
I do all kinds of things.

328
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,312
I showed you earlier, my other

329
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:49,030
project, I don't spare any technology.

330
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,968
Anything that helps me get where I

331
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:52,888
want to go, I will use it.

332
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,528
No, always in an ethical correct and safe way.

333
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:59,580
But any possible thing that we can use

334
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,938
and it's good to use, yes, that's valid.

335
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:05,260
Any ideas that can be developed are good, interesting,

336
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,380
and it's one of the principles of security, which

337
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,992
I forgot the number, but it's exactly about not

338
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:14,030
relying on technology to have security.

339
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,976
Like, I heard already some teams discussing like

340
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,376
I cannot encrypt this kind of data because

341
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:22,454
we don't have encryption on our framework.

342
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:23,780
So what the hell?

343
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,044
You are not encrypting because you

344
00:18:25,044 --> 00:18:25,882
don't have on their framework.

345
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:28,516
So find another framework, find a library or something.

346
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:29,482
But you need encryption.

347
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,400
That's the point.

348
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,478
And this is interesting point, Marcos.

349
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:36,952
I remember once we were working with some

350
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:39,912
partner, I would say, and they were kind

351
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:44,760
of struggling that they do not have any

352
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,472
kind of programmers, any kind of automated guys.

353
00:18:48,472 --> 00:18:49,768
They cannot run anything.

354
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,548
So they were looking for a tool

355
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,564
that we are selling this tool back.

356
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:54,908
That they were looking for a tool like, okay,

357
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:57,138
I just want to integrate this tool and push

358
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,564
a button and don't do anything more.

359
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:02,146
But they had all the pipelines we need to integrate,

360
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:05,184
we need to do the scanning strategy and so on.

361
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:07,200
Remember this case? Yes.

362
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,300
Remember this case?

363
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,468
In the past, I don't say the name, but in the

364
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:19,396
past, the people asking me about I don't have anything inside

365
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:26,046
my company, but I need to scan, I need to compile,

366
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:31,608
I need to put security to put everything inside my company,

367
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:36,498
but I have a low budget and I don't have tools.

368
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:40,492
Find a tool for me and the implants for

369
00:19:40,492 --> 00:19:46,012
inside my company now, easy, no, very easy.

370
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:50,774
And the most problem is people think cybersecurity

371
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:56,358
or tooling is afraid or don't have complexity.

372
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:59,968
And people think, oh, no, complexity. Easy.

373
00:19:59,968 --> 00:20:06,080
It's only one more two and you need two days for this.

374
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,530
It's not good. Exactly.

375
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,658
Terrible.

376
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:14,376
And Manuela, you mentioned the interesting point

377
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:17,038
now that you have kind of coding

378
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:19,758
skills, because you mentioned PowerShells and scripting.

379
00:20:19,758 --> 00:20:20,980
There scripting here.

380
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,460
Do you think this is kind of mandatory for this

381
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,986
style, as you described as DevOps or configuration manager?

382
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,900
Or do you believe that?

383
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,680
No, it's not mandatory for this area.

384
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,306
You can succeed without any scripting.

385
00:20:38,306 --> 00:20:41,340
Let's say it's mandatory for me.

386
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,270
Without it, I would feel very limited.

387
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,488
If you can just use what has already been

388
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:51,274
done by others, sometimes you also lose the ability

389
00:20:51,274 --> 00:20:54,836
to imagine what is feasible, what can be done.

390
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,122
And that's very empowering.

391
00:20:56,122 --> 00:21:00,190
That can give you that extra strength.

392
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,380
That good idea, that inspiration to do things better.

393
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,192
If you don't know how to make

394
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:10,168
things, you can just buy them, basically. Yeah.

395
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:10,728
Interesting.

396
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,740
So, Hodrigu, you are back already.

397
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,308
I have a question here with a lot of crying here.

398
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:22,732
No, that's fine.

399
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:24,220
I have a question for you.

400
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,572
Do you believe, like Manuela just mentioned,

401
00:21:26,572 --> 00:21:29,308
that it's mandatory for her to have

402
00:21:29,308 --> 00:21:32,134
scripting skills, let's say not developing skills,

403
00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,270
but scripting skills, which is different.

404
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,568
Do you believe the same for application security?

405
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,888
Like, we need to do code reviews daily, we

406
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:44,320
need to tune some Saskans for the customers.

407
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,718
Do you think it's coding?

408
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:48,010
Excuse me, I understand the code. It's mandatory.

409
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,190
Yeah, you need to know script.

410
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,758
For example, I make a troubleshoot for hazoot

411
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:01,620
of the desktop scan and the tool.

412
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,880
I can see what happened because a lot of

413
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,692
time for and I used some scripts in the

414
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:20,208
shell scripts to make for finding the Kind, I

415
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:25,174
lost maybe 30 minutes for doing this using script.

416
00:22:25,174 --> 00:22:28,176
So I lost a lot of hours in the

417
00:22:28,176 --> 00:22:31,872
tools to try to find the same thing.

418
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:36,690
So the shell script is a powerful tool.

419
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,250
When you see the Black Spring,

420
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,500
maybe you have some hardy things.

421
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:52,072
So for automating all the things you use scripts or,

422
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:57,110
I don't know, to gather some data or crawling.

423
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,890
It's mandatory.

424
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,200
No scripts for this.

425
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,920
Maybe all the areas in it.

426
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,120
Yes, I would argue that, especially for application

427
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,968
security, as we're mentioning, I see a lot

428
00:23:13,968 --> 00:23:16,192
of customers, a lot of developers, I mean,

429
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:18,768
not developers especially, but a lot of general

430
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:21,318
people involved in vulnerabilities.

431
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:25,008
They are marking some outputs from the tools, from

432
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:28,690
SaaS Solutions, from Das Solutions as a false positive.

433
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,412
And in two minutes discussion with the same

434
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:34,872
people around this vulnerability, I was proving them

435
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,398
that it was not false positive.

436
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,030
It was a real vulnerability.

437
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,342
Which makes me scary because I was a developer

438
00:23:41,342 --> 00:23:44,664
for 15 years in C sharp, Java, Python, whatever.

439
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,568
And when I see code and I see a

440
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:49,052
vulnerability, I know if it's vulnerable or not.

441
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,556
I know it's false positive or not.

442
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:53,596
But I don't believe that all the developers without

443
00:23:53,596 --> 00:23:57,196
the secured skills and all the security guys without

444
00:23:57,196 --> 00:24:00,594
the developing skills has the same approach.

445
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:02,928
When you find a vulnerability, it's the same.

446
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:04,928
You go to a doctor and one doctor say,

447
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:08,608
oh, unfortunately you have a concern and you go

448
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,912
to other ten doctors and no, you don't have

449
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:13,312
nothing, but you're going to stay with that one

450
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,594
in mind because that one is more dangerous.

451
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:16,820
Then you're going to find another

452
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,180
option, another opinion, another opinion. Then what?

453
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,476
Who are you going to believe?

454
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,044
And I think we have the same problem

455
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,124
when we talk about application security, because a

456
00:24:25,124 --> 00:24:27,512
lot of security guys don't know code and

457
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:29,464
a lot of developers don't know security.

458
00:24:29,464 --> 00:24:32,190
So they need to trust on the tools,

459
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,494
and the tools produce also false positives.

460
00:24:34,494 --> 00:24:37,598
It's normal, it's mathematically proven that it's

461
00:24:37,598 --> 00:24:40,334
impossible to not have any false positive

462
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:43,052
kind of scanning tools and so on. But Mark is gone.

463
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:44,390
You need to make some comments.

464
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,652
That's okay.

465
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:50,672
I have a comment because nowadays I'm working more

466
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:54,784
hard with the EAC if the infrastructure is a

467
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,816
code and I see so many vulnerabilities and the

468
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:08,324
people ignored this vulnerability because so many scans when

469
00:25:08,324 --> 00:25:11,668
I try to find, okay, let's go see.

470
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:16,360
And the guys I see the secrets inside the code

471
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,888
password, don't put the version of, for example, I know

472
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,190
how it is and no security is the group.

473
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,650
I find so many vulnerabilities.

474
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,172
Oh my God, you think is correct.

475
00:25:32,172 --> 00:25:34,280
Your secret is inside here.

476
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,390
Manuela, I have a question for you.

477
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,958
Do you have secrets on your PowerShell script?

478
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,900
Yeah, hopefully not yet.

479
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,050
I have secrets in places that manage secrets.

480
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,952
Awesome, perfect. Awesome.

481
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:54,932
I have one item in my backlog to

482
00:25:54,932 --> 00:25:57,204
run a scan to find out if somebody,

483
00:25:57,204 --> 00:25:59,802
without realizing, has stored secret somewhere.

484
00:25:59,802 --> 00:26:00,468
Very good.

485
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:03,348
But I have cybersecurity people in my organization, and

486
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:05,440
I talk with them and I work with them.

487
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,104
That's the point.

488
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:12,168
When you talk about security itself, because we have

489
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:14,344
application security, we're going to take care of the

490
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:17,240
application itself, and we have dev saccops absolutely.

491
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,748
That we're going to look for the

492
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:20,818
secrets on the codes, or who watches

493
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:23,314
the watcher, who can give permissions, etc.

494
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:27,180
We are discussing projects similar with this time ago.

495
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,748
And that's the point.

496
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:31,500
We understand the need of this and we grow.

497
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,552
We give you one step forward and one step forward.

498
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,872
And this is coming back to the future.

499
00:26:35,872 --> 00:26:38,992
As we are discussing, we are kind of open.

500
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,678
You are open to understand what's

501
00:26:40,678 --> 00:26:42,294
the need from the security perspective.

502
00:26:42,294 --> 00:26:44,132
I am open to understand what is the need

503
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:45,972
to run with the scripts and so on.

504
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,788
And we match these two ideas, let's say, to

505
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:52,650
have a better solution for me as DevOps.

506
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,492
When I find a problem, I like to have

507
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:57,848
someone whom I can trust to say, okay, I

508
00:26:57,848 --> 00:26:59,416
have this thing, I don't know what to manage,

509
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:04,120
because this is not my idea of expertise. Help me.

510
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,488
When there is this contact, then I can come to you.

511
00:27:06,488 --> 00:27:08,248
If I find a vulnerability, I can come to you.

512
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:08,876
I can talk.

513
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:10,380
Okay, I found this.

514
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,612
Now what?

515
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:15,468
Before, I can believe that tendency to say, no, this

516
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,148
is not a problem, because I don't know what to

517
00:27:17,148 --> 00:27:20,732
do with it if it's a problem now. Very good.

518
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:22,902
So this advice all the developers

519
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,368
listening to us should take.

520
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:25,574
Oh, I found Aunt Abett.

521
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:26,832
What I have to do with this?

522
00:27:26,832 --> 00:27:28,896
Do not suppress the warnings, do not

523
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,288
ignore the code and so on.

524
00:27:30,288 --> 00:27:33,574
Because as I always say, when we need to defend

525
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:36,884
our company, we need to know about all our problems.

526
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:38,868
When the hacker needs to attack, he

527
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,820
just need to know about one problem.

528
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,780
They just need one breach, one door, only one.

529
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,434
And we need to know all of them to defend.

530
00:27:45,434 --> 00:27:47,464
So it's much more harder for us.

531
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:51,006
And usually we work with the Avengers.

532
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:53,198
When something screw up, they call the Avengers.

533
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:56,584
The security, come here, we have a problem.

534
00:27:56,584 --> 00:27:57,534
Call the Avengers.

535
00:27:57,534 --> 00:28:00,076
But it's already done, guys, sorry, sometimes

536
00:28:00,076 --> 00:28:02,124
you don't have it to do.

537
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:05,938
Okay, so coming back to our main topic,

538
00:28:05,938 --> 00:28:07,692
let's say, manuela, what do you think?

539
00:28:07,692 --> 00:28:12,608
What do you believe, actually, that are the challenge not

540
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:17,398
for you, but for the arena challenge in this DevOps

541
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:21,130
device, tech, ops, security stuff, even best practices.

542
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,960
What do you feel that is the most hard part for you?

543
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,668
Okay, the worst part for me is when we have

544
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,948
many tools and they don't really talk to each other.

545
00:28:32,948 --> 00:28:37,576
Like we do scanning for open source, and

546
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:39,608
we have the results in one place.

547
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,608
We do static code analysis, and we have

548
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:45,948
results in another place, and our results of

549
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:48,684
the pipelines are deliverables in another place and

550
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:50,668
they're not maybe related to each other.

551
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:54,188
That's a kind of spaghetti DevOps where

552
00:28:54,188 --> 00:28:57,980
you don't know anything and it's crazy.

553
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,028
You know, you have lots of data, you don't really know

554
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:03,152
what to do with it, how to relate one the result

555
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:05,728
of a tool with the result of another, and how to

556
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:08,860
really process and have a meaningful process around it.

557
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,090
Interesting.

558
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,098
Do you also believe that lack

559
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:16,164
of documentation is a problem? Also?

560
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:18,308
Some companies I don't know.

561
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:21,252
It's risk for companies, especially when

562
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:23,096
people keep changing, that for sure.

563
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:26,270
But I would see it as a general risk,

564
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:32,446
not specific to DevOps or devs ups that's risk

565
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:35,480
for everything around what that company does.

566
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,440
You can arrange business rules or whatever?

567
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,482
Yes, if only you rely on one person, this person dies.

568
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:47,990
That person decides to go on vacation or fire or die.

569
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,050
Okay, maybe that's not a conscious decision.

570
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,980
People can find a better job at our

571
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,418
maybe rival company in a day and disappear

572
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,490
because they really want that person.

573
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,150
These things can happen, and we'd better be prepared.

574
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:08,720
Okay.

575
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,852
Someone even mentioned something.

576
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:15,460
Hodrigo or Martin also no, I think about this question.

577
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:25,390
The most challenge to implement

578
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,900
something is just the future.

579
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,692
And the people don't open for the my son

580
00:30:31,692 --> 00:30:34,070
who doesn't want to remove the Christmas tree.

581
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,400
How do you convince him?

582
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,596
Okay, in this case, he's a four year old,

583
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:43,660
so he would do it when he's ready.

584
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,432
Maybe we can do other things

585
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:50,368
because we're dealing with adults. Exactly. Exactly.

586
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:53,424
So, for example, few days ago, I had a

587
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:57,492
discussion with a team around hardening, hardening stuff.

588
00:30:57,492 --> 00:30:59,620
And this team was saying, no, we are using

589
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,630
containers, we don't need to care about hardening.

590
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,248
And I was, okay, but you use a container, you

591
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:09,220
have a base image, you open ports to this application.

592
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,022
How do your file system configurated?

593
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:16,760
You can access anything on the file system.

594
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,038
You have read permissions, write permissions.

595
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,076
So you have some raw hardening to take care of.

596
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:23,932
But that was the point.

597
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:25,612
They didn't know, and they are just

598
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:27,260
avoiding to do the requirements there.

599
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,308
And I was discussing like, okay, guys, you need to

600
00:31:29,308 --> 00:31:32,544
take care of this, because they were open to listen.

601
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,502
Okay, we didn't see this perspective.

602
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:36,848
Okay, so we need to handle we know how to

603
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:39,808
handle we were going to implement this, but it was

604
00:31:39,808 --> 00:31:44,210
just five minutes talk and everybody understands what I most

605
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,058
face during the day or daily basis, even with partners

606
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:50,884
and customers and so on is this problem.

607
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:53,492
Some of them don't want to talk, as

608
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:55,890
Manuel was mentioned, like, I don't have time

609
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,672
you can even talk to to these people.

610
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:59,288
And this is the problem.

611
00:31:59,288 --> 00:32:01,816
How to reach this guy, how to and

612
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:05,848
one interesting case company that I work, we

613
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:08,258
had the kind of a workshop monthly.

614
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:11,138
And this workshop was around the Vulnerabilities

615
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,924
best practice and security and so on.

616
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:15,836
And it was not working, but stopped working

617
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:19,790
when I was presenting incidents on the workshop.

618
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,046
Random incidents.

619
00:32:21,046 --> 00:32:23,328
But in the end of the workshop I was

620
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:25,926
telling, look guys, for this specific thing this incident

621
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:29,504
happened in your system last week we had a

622
00:32:29,504 --> 00:32:34,788
breach and some something this imaginary fear to the

623
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,332
reality of them like oh, this is happening, it

624
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:39,706
already happened and we had an impact.

625
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:42,964
It was making them move the managers and so on.

626
00:32:42,964 --> 00:32:44,888
They were going to the chairs and okay, now

627
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:46,392
we need to do a course, we need to

628
00:32:46,392 --> 00:32:49,544
start scanning, we need to start this and that.

629
00:32:49,544 --> 00:32:54,142
But you know, this reaction instead of being proactive

630
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:59,484
on this, protecting it's what I still struggle and

631
00:32:59,484 --> 00:33:01,676
I'm kind of how do we make it better?

632
00:33:01,676 --> 00:33:02,876
How can we do it better?

633
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:05,372
Somehow it sounds to me like there

634
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:08,882
is one component of fear that arouses

635
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:11,718
interest but it's also about storytelling.

636
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:13,808
When you tell a story, whether it's bad or

637
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:16,272
good, we humans are good at processing it.

638
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:20,300
If you just present data less good at it.

639
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,000
If you have this kind of story, this thing happened.

640
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,708
Okay, there's interest and the same goes sometimes when

641
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:31,610
I do meetings or what I'm engaging with communities.

642
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,470
People want to say that they like success stories

643
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,768
whenever we ask, okay, what kind of topics would

644
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,502
you like to include in our next meeting?

645
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:42,366
Success stories.

646
00:33:42,366 --> 00:33:44,072
They want to know what has happened,

647
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:46,588
what people have done, good or bad.

648
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:49,468
Okay, sometimes, but mostly they like to hear good

649
00:33:49,468 --> 00:33:53,100
news and I think that this could be this

650
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,236
could help us with communication and with having more

651
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:59,132
interests or openness to listen to us.

652
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:02,368
As a good Brazilian, I would say that Brazilians like this

653
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,944
popopolis a lot of drag them out and so on.

654
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:06,940
So maybe the bad parts would be good.

655
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,893
Once upon a time there was a database

656
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:12,409
with a credit card information and was leaked.

657
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,110
Good it was yours.

658
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,929
Interesting about to start telling

659
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,467
you what do you think?

660
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:25,976
Marks very strangely but because of this history I remember one

661
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:37,752
of their history a long time ago my boss no have

662
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:42,449
a good idea andy I asked my help oh my gosh.

663
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,297
I need to turn off the logs

664
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:49,020
because we have a lost space.

665
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,447
We don't have more space inside the servers and you need

666
00:34:54,447 --> 00:35:01,860
to turn off the logs because no space, same space.

667
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:05,540
Okay, I turn off the logs, but advice okay,

668
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,066
but if I have some problems during this prior

669
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:12,500
I don't have any chance to find the problem.

670
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,790
Okay, that's okay.

671
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,312
Sometime a little time after I turn

672
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:21,410
off the logs, we have a leak.

673
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,072
So many information of one of these employees was

674
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:31,496
leakaged and my boss okay, mark find the person

675
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:35,804
was leaked okay turn on the logs because I

676
00:35:35,804 --> 00:35:38,550
don't have logs to find the person was leaked.

677
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:44,896
This.

678
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:47,020
Story is not new for us.

679
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,110
This is true, actually, and it's funny.

680
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,392
Turn off the loud to save some space.

681
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:59,140
The best one terrible is the same one.

682
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,508
The opposite would be like something that I

683
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:04,996
heard a lot is give admin access because

684
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,000
you need to do something admin access.

685
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,862
Sometimes you don't need full admin

686
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,230
access, you just need specific permission.

687
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,798
But admin is easier.

688
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:16,248
In this case, for example, to save space, turn

689
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:18,360
off the log instead of doing kind of a

690
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,684
rotation or deleting all the data and so on.

691
00:36:20,684 --> 00:36:23,308
But turn off the logs anyway.

692
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:25,400
The best idea when I see my life.

693
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,688
Manuel, another point that I would

694
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,180
like to discuss is around education.

695
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,980
What do you think?

696
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,102
For listeners?

697
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:39,488
Either for security people, developers, what it's good for

698
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:43,300
them to learn about what you do, for example,

699
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,324
on DevOps or config management and so on.

700
00:36:46,324 --> 00:36:48,388
What it's good for them to learn if they

701
00:36:48,388 --> 00:36:52,756
want to be more collaborative for you, or either

702
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:56,488
for who wants to work as you do what

703
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:58,360
they need to learn, what they need to study.

704
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,910
What do you learn?

705
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,296
Okay, regarding configuration management, it's quite

706
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:06,492
difficult to learn about it. I think.

707
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:07,932
There are only a couple of

708
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:10,412
university courses specifically on it.

709
00:37:10,412 --> 00:37:12,092
One is in Sweden and one could

710
00:37:12,092 --> 00:37:16,040
be in Brazil, maybe, I'm not sure.

711
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,118
There are, of course, books.

712
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:23,696
There are people who write about it.

713
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:25,968
There are some communities, but

714
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:30,198
that's quite difficult to digest.

715
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:33,386
I like to read a lot DevOps blogs.

716
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:37,332
There's a lot about communicating, what they do,

717
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:39,258
how they do it, what are the results.

718
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,002
That's very practical, very understandable.

719
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:43,114
So I would look for resources for blogs

720
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:46,424
like DevOps something or dev second Ops something.

721
00:37:46,424 --> 00:37:48,952
And I would search for the kind of

722
00:37:48,952 --> 00:37:51,090
tools and how they can be integrated.

723
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,448
Regarding learning, okay, it depends a lot on

724
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:58,626
what tools you use, but some common technologies,

725
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:00,428
some common things that you may want to

726
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:04,114
learn are YAML for managing pipelines?

727
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:07,270
This is valid for Asia DevOps, for GitHub.

728
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,992
I don't know where else it is used, but I use that

729
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:14,720
a lot on a daily basis and some script, whatever you like.

730
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,328
Nowadays, I think most systems allow us to

731
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,288
write scripts and use code from any kind

732
00:38:20,288 --> 00:38:24,576
of scripting language, executable, ZLS, whatever.

733
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:28,404
So what is it comfortable to you keep using it?

734
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:30,650
I have studied Java at university.

735
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:35,250
I use a lot of C sharp when I need to use PowerShell.

736
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,856
I'm curious about learning more web oriented stuff

737
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:43,886
because I see many things happening in pipelines

738
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:46,200
or extensions being developed like that.

739
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:54,920
Be curious about something to this list.

740
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:04,512
Now maybe manuel talk about the tools, but the one

741
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:10,886
thing I think now is you need to be curious.

742
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:16,868
You need to want to learn more and more all the

743
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:21,060
days now that the new stuff come all the days.

744
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:28,088
So you will be to manage some new tool or you

745
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:34,360
need to learn you need to be interesting for this technology.

746
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,624
Yeah, that's the point.

747
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:39,948
Because I don't want to say my age, but from

748
00:39:39,948 --> 00:39:42,956
the past we were like I am the back end

749
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:46,370
developer, don't bother me with CSS and JavaScript.

750
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:48,780
I am the C sharp guy, fuck you.

751
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,072
It starts moving to now you need to

752
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:56,230
start dealing with the interface, which I hate.

753
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,608
Now you need to document, then you need to know

754
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:03,872
about database and then now you have full stack whatever.

755
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:05,988
Now you need to do DevOps because you

756
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,962
need to from the code to production.

757
00:40:07,962 --> 00:40:10,804
But don't forget about security and you need

758
00:40:10,804 --> 00:40:12,532
to do testing and you need to make

759
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:21,550
coffee and clean your desk already stressed.

760
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,136
You need to know a lot of things and

761
00:40:26,136 --> 00:40:29,900
maybe this is also hard to keep important things.

762
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,916
So for example, security is one of them.

763
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:34,060
Quality in general, I would say it's one of them.

764
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,690
Because if you are focused on the coding, performance

765
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,404
and best practice of the code itself, today and

766
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:43,068
tomorrow you're going to think about security.

767
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,998
And tomorrow you understand better integration

768
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:46,934
on your pipeline and testing.

769
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:48,048
Live for the Q and A

770
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:50,502
team and about configuration in production.

771
00:40:50,502 --> 00:40:51,664
You don't care.

772
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:55,968
And maybe all these things that you need, I

773
00:40:55,968 --> 00:40:59,028
mean market is forcing us to know from one

774
00:40:59,028 --> 00:41:01,428
perspective it's good, I don't complain about it.

775
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:03,876
But from the other one we may let

776
00:41:03,876 --> 00:41:07,028
other things be less important for us.

777
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:10,072
So for example, I would say Manuela, she has her focus.

778
00:41:10,072 --> 00:41:12,024
My focus is this part of the job.

779
00:41:12,024 --> 00:41:14,574
I will not care about best coding practices.

780
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:16,408
For example, I need my scripted to run, I

781
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:19,068
need to get data from here and put there. That's all.

782
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:20,300
You understand the point.

783
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,802
Maybe I should not be worried about modeling

784
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:25,660
these creeds or creating a real program to

785
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,466
being reused and just some examples.

786
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:29,936
But there is some kind of

787
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:31,926
point of contact between these roles.

788
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:35,952
For example, I don't care about the details of

789
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:39,088
coding guidelines, but I am aware of it.

790
00:41:39,088 --> 00:41:42,548
And if someone in my team needs to work with them,

791
00:41:42,548 --> 00:41:47,172
I can point them to a way to embed the pull

792
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:51,396
request checklist automatically in their repo in order to use this.

793
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:54,840
So there is a kind of process or flow around

794
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,406
these things and we need maybe at least a minimum

795
00:41:57,406 --> 00:42:00,168
amount of understanding of the other topics, how they are

796
00:42:00,168 --> 00:42:02,340
relevant and how they are tied together.

797
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:09,784
I'm supporting multiple teams and there's a lot of

798
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:11,532
work to do, so I cannot do it all.

799
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:12,972
And that's something very common

800
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:14,220
that happens to everyone.

801
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,044
So there are some people in

802
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:17,756
my teams that are more interested.

803
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:22,050
There's one guy who's very curious about Yamaha

804
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:24,544
pipelines and the moment he showed interest, I

805
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:26,352
was very happy to talk with him.

806
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:27,462
He's a tester.

807
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,632
I was very happy to talk with him to share

808
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:32,118
some tips and tricks and now he's doing quite advanced

809
00:42:32,118 --> 00:42:36,180
stuff on his own, but I have less workload. He is happy.

810
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,588
He's getting what he wants.

811
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,508
And he has also learned something fun.

812
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:41,348
That something that he enjoys doing, which

813
00:42:41,348 --> 00:42:44,104
is not 100% his core business.

814
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,650
But we have this collaboration.

815
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,460
It's good.

816
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,120
Manila is talking.

817
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,268
Remember when Daniella talked with us and Danielle is

818
00:42:56,268 --> 00:42:59,400
a VP of Engineering and study a lot.

819
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,610
She needs to code in nowadays.

820
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,840
And it's good.

821
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:08,588
Very good.

822
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:12,028
This episode with Daniella was actually was

823
00:43:12,028 --> 00:43:14,418
one more teacher because she's from Portugal.

824
00:43:14,418 --> 00:43:16,130
We are moochi culture.

825
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,292
And it was about half specifically because she

826
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:22,602
is the VP of Engineer from Checkmark.

827
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:24,644
She knows everything about gold scanning and

828
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,940
so on and all this works.
